## Description
For homework assignment 10 I was tasked with creating a Template Engine for Employee Summaries. With this application you can easily and quickly build a dynamic team sheet based on the user criteria. 

I found this to be a challenging assignment but it enhanced my understanding of ES6 classes, Jest, Node and Inquirer.

## Installation
To install this application you must have node and inquirer installed

## Usage
In order to get this application to run you must open up the terminal and enter the following:

```
node app.js
```
You will then be prompted with a series of questions in the following order

1. Role
2. Name
3. ID
4. Email
5. Usage
6. Office Number if you selected Manager as role
7. GitHub username if you selected Engineer as role
8. School if you selected Intern as role
9. You will then be asked if you would like to add more team members. If the user chooses to add more members then the questions will start again from the beginning. If the user selects no, then the file will be written and placed in the output directory.
